![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps

This section should restate the assignment and explain how you analyzed the requirements in order 
to develop a solution.

### Design

How did you approach your program design? Did you use multiple classes to define various objects?

I created a folder for the server and client, and a class for each.
The server set up the connection and the client would connect
They both had a text field to type and a text area to display the chat

### Testing

A step by step series of examples that you developed to properly test the program. 

Say what the step will be

I would make changes to the way the server and client would connect to each other then run the program to see if it would work.

And repeat

I would also test if they would send text back and forth, I could get the client to send text to the server but it took a while to get the 
client to send it to the server.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
