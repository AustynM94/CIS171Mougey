![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps

I started by creating the TextFields then made the button after that I created the panes to hold the TextFields and disabled the Canadian Dollars one so it was uneditable, then I created the event handler for the button with the math to convert the USD to Canadian Dollars and create the output to be placed in the Canadian Dollars TextField

### Design

How did you approach your program design? Did you use multiple classes to define various objects?

I used multiple TextFields for the USD and Canadian Dollars, a button, and an event handler to convert the USD to Canadian Dollars when clicked

### Testing

A step by step series of examples that you developed to properly test the program. 

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
