# Grading Notes

The sort is set up very well. Good use of classes for each sort!
The array must be identical for each sort so that we are comparing apples to apples. In this implementation, the array is sorted by the selection sort,
then the sorted array is passed to each of the other sorts. We are not getting a valid comparison. Must clone the array to pass to each sort.
